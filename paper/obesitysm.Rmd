# Converting NHES data into effective counts

Here we describe how we convert the raw National Health Examination Survey data into effective counts.

Let $o_{i}$ be 1 if the $i$th respondent in an NHES sample is obese, and 0 otherwise; let $w_{i}$ be the survey weight for that respondent; let $\eta_{as}$ denote the set of all respondents in age group $a$ and sex $s$; and let $\tilde{n}_{as}$ be the number of respondents. We calculate 
$$
  p_{as} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \eta_{as}} w_i o_i}{\sum_{i \in \eta_{as}} w_i},
$$
the obesity prevalence within that combination of age, sex, and year, estimated using survey weights. We also calculate the variance in weights
$$
  V_{as} = \frac{\sum_{i \in \eta_{as}}(w_i - \bar{w}_{as})^2}{\tilde{n}_{as}-1},
$$
and define design effect
$$
d_{as} = 1 + \frac{V_{as}}{\bar{w}_{as}^2}.
$$
The value $d_{as}$ measures the extent to which sampling in age-sex group $as$ departs from simple random sampling. The higher the value of $d_{as}$, the greater the departure. Let $d^*$ denote the median value for $d_{as}$. We define effective sample size as $n_{as} = \tilde{n}_{as}/d^*$ and define the effective number of obese respondents as $y_{as} = p_{as} n_{as}$. Before applying our model, we round $n_{as}$ and $y_{as}$ to obtain whole numbers.

This procedure is identical to that in @ghitza2013deep, except that we use the median design effect, rather than the mean, on the grounds that the median is more robust to outliers.


# Dropping the age-specific bias term from the data model for schools

Fig 2 below shows national estimates and forecasts when the data model for schools does not have an age-specific bias term. Fig 3b in the main text shows the equivalent estimates and forecasts when the data model for schools does have an age-specific bias term. Without the bias term, there is one-off change in apparent prevalences for children aged 2--4 when moving from the period covered by the NHES and HDTC data to the period covered by the schools data. The widths of the credible intervals are also reduced. The one-off change appears implausible. Given that there is uncertainty about age-specific biases, the wider credible intervals of the main model are, we believe, more appropriate.

# Converting WHO obesity estimates into effective counts

Our procedure for converting WHO obesity estimates into effective counts is a modified version of the procedure for turning NHES data into effective counts.

Let $p_{cst}$ be the estimated prevalence for sex $s$ in country $c$ in year $t$. Let $w_{cst}$ be the width of the associated 95% confidence interval. The width of a 95% confidence interval should equal approximately 4 standard deviations. If we treat $p_{cst}$ as being derived from the effective number of obese respondents divided by the effective number of respondents $n'_{cst}$, then one standard deviation equals $\sqrt{n'_{cst} p_{cst} (1 - p_{cwt})}$. We solve the equation
\begin{equation}
  w_{cst} = 4 \sqrt{n'_{cst} p_{cst} (1 - p_{cwt})}
\end{equation}
to obtain a value for $n_{cst}$. Individual values of $n'_{cst}$ can be very noisy, so we set $n_{cwt}^{\text{W}}$ equal to the median of $n'_{cst}$ across $s$ and $t$. We then set $y_{cst}^{\text{W}} = p_{cst} n_{cwt}^{\text{W}}$. 


# Deriving prior distributions from WHO data

Having fitted our model to the WHO data we obtain a sample $\tau_{\beta}^{\text{WHO}(k)}, k = 1, \cdots, K$ from the posterior distribution for $\tau_{\beta}^{\text{WHO}}$. We calculate $S^2 = \sum_{k=1}^K (\tau_{\beta}^{\text{WHO}(k)})^2$, and use $N(0, S^2)$ as our initial prior for $\tau_{\beta}$ in (4) in the main model. We obtain initial priors for $\tau_{\alpha}$ and $\tau_{\delta}$ in the same way.

The fitted model for the WHO data also yields sample $\phi^{\text{WHO}(k)}$ from the posterior distribution for $\phi^{\text{WHO}}$. We set $\tilde{\phi}^{\text{WHO}} = \frac{\phi^{\text{WHO}(k) - 0.8}}{1 - 0.8}$, and calculate $m = \sum_{k = 1}^K \tilde{\phi}^{\text{WHO}(k)}$ and $V = \sum_{k = 1}^K (\tilde{\phi}^{\text{WHO}(k)} - m)^2 / K$. We set $a = m \left(\frac{m(1-m)}{v} - 1\right)$ and $b = (1-m) a$, and use $\text{Beta}(a, b)$ as our initial prior for $\phi$ in the main model.

As discussed in the main text, we suspect that our initial posterior distributions for $\tau_{\beta}$, $\tau_{\alpha}$, $\tau_{\delta}$, and $\phi$ may understate true year-to-year variability. We therefore construct modified versions of the priors that allow for greater variability. Let $k$ be a multiplier, which in practice we set to 2 and 4. Our modified version of the prior for $\tau_{\beta}$ is simply $N(0, (kS)^2)$, and similarly for $\tau_{\alpha}$ and $\tau_{\delta}$. To obtain the modified version of the prior for $\phi$, we multiply $V$ by $k$.
